	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedAdeptusMechanicus" value="Why these Tech-Priests rebelled, you do not know—Mars has a thousand schisms and loyalties, and even the truest Magos knows mind-scouring secrets they would die for. Here, all their wisdom, and all their learning, and all their faith served for naught as they chose to employ it against you. And now they are fit only for the soylent vats and the smelters."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedAstraMilitarum" value="As the leader of the Imperial Guard breathes his last, you lower his body to ground with something like respect. These men were loyal Imperial warriors on a world rife with heresy and corruption. Better they die by your hand, than turned by some Xenos filth."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedChaosWildlife" value="Honour is satisfied—the heretic Astartes have breathed their last, their Daemon Engines reduced to motiveless piles of flesh and metal, their inhabitants fled back to the Warp. Whether Gladius Prime survives or not, its population will not fall to the Dark Gods."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedEldar" value="There’s nothing like a chainsword to teach you that all your superiority and intellect is for naught. Why do they waste their bodies and minds against us, when we agree that there are worse foes to face? At least they gave us this opportunity to eliminate their heresy and double-dealing."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedNecrons" value="The green light fades from the last artificial eye, as the last Necron gives up the fight. After immeasurable aeons of war, their cities are crushed, their troops atomised, and their leaders slain. Though beneath the planet's surface, millions more still slumber in deathly unquiet, let's call this a victory."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedOrks" value="The Greenskin menace has been defeated. Though that is not to say that it has been eliminated. Even though every Ork, Grot and Snotling is dead, their corpses are already spreading the spores that will raise a new army of Greenskins in a generation. They will be a fine challenge for your Aspirants to battle, when the Chapter is fully established once more."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedSistersOfBattle" value="The faith of these pseudo-Marines, both in the Emperor-as-God and in their own abilities, was woefully misplaced. Their righteousness and fervour proved unmatched to the Adeptus Astartes, the product of the Emperor’s own hand. At least no more innocents will die on their pyres."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedWildlife" value="Traitors or not, your fellow Space Marines have now been wiped from the face of Gladius Prime. When the High Lords of Terra hear of this, the traditional orisons and dirges will fill the Imperial Palace, and the Chapter's name will be formally excised from the papyri."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedTau" value="For such a tiny race, they fought with courage. And their technology, heretical as it was, was indubitably effective. But against the Adeptus Astartes, the sons of the Primarchs, there could only be one outcome."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDefeatedTyranids" value="The Great Devourer's incursion has been dispersed, with the synapse creatures obliterated and even the rippers crushed beneath your troops' ceramite boots. Yet out there, in the galactic void, how many more millions and billions watch and wait..?"/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredAdeptusMechanicus" value="Followers of the Machine God. Their unwavering faith in their Omnissiah has led them into conflict with the Adeptus Astartes before so you are prepared when they open fire. They are more deadly than their spindly forms present, equipped with Mars’ secret technologies, with their weaknesses surgically excised in favour of ancient mechanisms."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredAstraMilitarum" value="An army of the Imperial Guard is present here, then? Sadly, given the depths of the Xenos infestation here and the potential for heresy, they can't be allowed to leave the planet. They are an obstacle to your reconquest of your Chapter World, not an aid."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredChaosWildlife" value="To see your brothers fallen so far from the Emperor's light… it shames you all. You must, of course, defeat these heretics to secure Gladius Prime for the Imperium—but you must also defeat them for your honour, for your many kin that have died at these self-same hands over the ten millennia since the massacre at Istvan III."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredEldar" value="As sure as night is day, where there’s strife, you’ll find the Aeldari. They may be the last of a dying race, aeons in the passing, but any time a war seems to be getting serious, there they are. Beware their tricks, do not underestimate their intellect and speed. They may be xenos but they are elegant and agile warriors."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredNecrons" value="The Necrons may only have emerged from their slumber recently in galactic terms and only a fraction of them are awake, but they have already proved themselves a thorn in the Imperium's side. Relentless, heavily-armoured enemies with devastating firepower, they should be fought with care and respect."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredOrks" value="The endless wild careen of the violent Ork race across the galaxy would be comical, if it weren't so devastating to the Imperium. They've already destroyed this once-precious Imperial colony, your Chapter World—you must prevent them from destroying your Chapter too. And remember, they're not as stupid as they seem."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredSistersOfBattle" value="The oldest of your brethren remember being told by even more ancient Adeptus Astartes of the days when the Battle Sisters were mere ascetic fanatics living on San Leor, calling themselves The Daughters of the Emperor. Millenia later, the same fanatics have the military and economy backing of the Ecclesiarchy, share your sacred tools, and seek to match themselves against the Emperor’s own sons. You should show them who the Emperor truly favours."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredWildlife" value="Your brother Space Marines, as strong and noble as you—notionally. Their unannounced presence on your homeworld is troubling though, as is their refusal to respond to your comms with anything other than bolter fire. We must assume that they are hostile until we hear otherwise."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredTau" value="When our Imperium first encountered these squalid xenos, they were little more than stone-throwing savages. Now, only ten thousand years have passed and they carry their heretical weaponry with pride. We should purge them from the galaxy, before they can take another step."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeDiscoveredTyranids" value="Since the Imperium first encountered the Tyranids on Tyran Prime, regiments, systems and even Chapters have been destroyed battling the many Hive Fleets. However, even as the Tyranids adapt to their foes, the Space Marines too have learned how to fight the Great Devourer's troops most effectively."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeFlavor" value="<style name='Italic'/>“One unbreakable shield against the coming darkness. One last blade, forged in defiance of fate.”<br/>  — The Emperor of Mankind<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>With bolters blazing, the Battle-Brothers of the Adeptus Astartes crush the foes of the Imperium wherever they may be found. Each Space Marine is an elite, genetically-engineered, cybernetically-enhanced super-soldier, a mighty and fearless hero worth a hundred lesser men.<br/><br/>Each Space Marine is recruited into a thousand-man Chapter, before they are extensively modified, with nineteen extra organs and the crucial Chapter gene-seed. From the numerous Ultramarines and mysterious Dark Angels to the fierce Space Wolves and tormented Blood Angels, each chapter has its own traditions and style of combat.<br/><br/>Armed with the finest weapons the Imperium can provide, clad in suits of intimidating ceramite power armour and borne to war aboard swift and deadly fighting vehicles, they are the Imperium's ultimate weapon. Though relatively few in number, it is the Adeptus Astartes who represent Humanity's best hope for survival—for they are the greatest warriors the galaxy has ever known."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeLostFlavor" value="And with that blow, another of the Emperor's creations is eliminated forever. The wargear and relics of your chapter will be scattered across the fertile soils of Gladius Prime, to join the innumerable artefacts already there. No-one will avenge you, because they will not know you're gone until the warp storms dissipate generations hence and Explorators visit the planet again.<br/><br/>When that happens and the message reaches Terra, the High Lords will slump lower into their thrones. The sages of the Departmento Munitorum will strike the Chapter from the records, place its remaining relics and insignia into the Halls of the Fallen, and look to approve a new founding for a new Chapter. And you will pass into history."/>

	<entry name="WildlifeShortFlavor" value="Genetically-engineered warriors clad in iconic power armour, the Space Marines are tasked with the protection of the Imperium of Man. They are the greatest soldiers the galaxy has ever known."/>
	<entry name="WildlifeWonEliminationFlavor" value="It was arrogant of the Xenos to suppose that they could assault a Chapter world of the Imperial Space Marines, even an under-strength one, and secure an easy victory. Even decimated as you were by endless war, even weakened as you were by the mysterious warpstorms, you rebuilt in the midst of heavy fighting and crushed your enemies one after another.<br/><br/>This war has been a test for your Marines, one that you've passed well. As the scattered remnants of the Xenos retreat to the dark corners of the planet, your Chapter has emerged stronger than before. Now, you can rebuild the Chapter properly from the planet's surviving population and turn this into a worthy homeworld.<br/><br/>And perhaps now, in your strength, you will have time to explore the planet more thoroughly. To find the source of the warpstorms, to root out the remaining Old One secrets. Pray that no-one else finds them before you…"/>
	<entry name="WildlifeWonQuestFlavor" value="The Chapter Master fulfilled his duty to the Emperor, at an immeasurable cost to the Imperium—Gladius Prime has been scoured clean by the Exodite device, down to its rocky surface. It will be a long and slow road towards re-establishing the Chapter after this disastrous 'victory'. The Chapter's few survivors will need to find a new planet to call home. Then the Fortress will need to be reconstructed from scratch, new recruits found, trained, tested and modified, and gene-seed implanted. For generations, the Chapter will rebuild, whilst others seize the glories that should have been yours.<br/><br/>Yet, one day, elsewhere in the Imperium, Roboute Guilliman will lead the Space Marines again, standing side by side with the Astra Militarum and the Techpriests, against the old enemies. And this Chapter, replenished, a thousand superhuman heroes strong, will fight alongside them. For the chapter's glory—and for the Emperor!"/>
